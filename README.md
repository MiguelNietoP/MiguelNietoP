- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel (@MiguelNietoP) and I'm an Ecuadorian/Spanish Data Scientist who is just beginning in this exciting world of data and its utilities. From visualizations and statistics to prediction models using Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I'm in the process of becoming the best version of myself both personally and professionally.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming Languages, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, Statistics, Economics, Technology and Video Games.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently completing my study at Hack A Boss's Data Science bootcamp where I've been learning about Python, Data Processing, ETL tools, EDA tools, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data, MySQL and Power BI.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects that teach me new aspects of knowledge about my profession and where I can contribute with what I already know to add value as a team. Besides, who doesn't enjoy having a good time while working on a project?.
